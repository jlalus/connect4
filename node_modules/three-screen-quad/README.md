# three-screen-quad
[![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

a screen aligned quad for [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)

ThreeJS element for drawing stuff to screen. It doesn't transform the plane on the cpu and uses the vertex shader to position it on screen. An abstract class controls a couple of uniforms and can figure out sizes in pixels. Setting `top:'25px',left:'25px` will keep the element anchored to the edge of the canvas. [Live](http://dusanbosnjak.com/test/webGL/three-screen-quad/).

```js
var THREE = require('three')
var ScreenQuad = require('three-screen-quad')(THREE)

var screenQuad;

function start(gl, width, height) {

    renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
        canvas: gl.canvas
    });

    scene = new THREE.Scene();
    
    camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(50, width/height, 1, 1000);
    
    camera.position.set( 0 , 0 , -10 );

    camera.lookAt( new THREE.Vector3() )

    //will make a quad thats 25% of the screen size in both directions
    //offset in pixels from top left corner 

    screenQuad = new ScreenQuad({
    	width: 0.25,
    	height: 0.25,
    	top: '25px',
    	left: '25px'
    });

    screenQuad.setScreenSize( renderer.getSize().width , renderer.getSize().height );

    scene.add(screenQuad);

}

function render(gl, width, height) {
    renderer.render(scene, camera)
}

function onWindowResize( width , height ){
	
	//if a value is set in pixels, the canvas size needs to be set on the element
	screenQuad.setScreenSize( width , height );

}
```

## Usage
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/three-screen-quad.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/three-screen-quad)

#### `ScreenQuad = require('three-screen-quad')(THREE)`

This module exports a function which accepts an instance of THREE, and returns a ScreenQuad class. This allows you to use the module with CommonJS, globals, etc.

The returned function has the following constructor pattern, and extends THREE.Mesh. See [three-fps-counter](https://github.com/pailhead/three-fps-counter) for an example on how to make an element that just renders to screen without being added to the graph.

```js
screenQuad = new ScreenQuad({
	width: 	   0.5, 
	height:    '50px',
	top:       0.25, 
	left:      '25px',
    bottom:     0.5,           //top will override bottom if both are present in arguments
    right:      0.5,           //left will override right
    texture:    myTexture,     //to use the default shader
    debug:      false          //true will render UVs of the quad
})
```

##methods

**setWidth( float | string )** - width of the element. 

**setHeight( float | string )** - height of the element. 

**setTop( float | string )** - distance from top of the canvas. 

**setLeft( float | string )** - distance from the left edge of the canvas. 

**setBottom( float | string )** - distance from bottom of the canvas. 

**setRight( float | string )** - distance from the right edge of the canvas. 

**setSize( width , height )** - sets both width and height at the same time

_(Each argument can be either a float representing percentage **0.0 - 1.0**, or string representing pixel size **'25px'**)_;

**setScreenSize( width , height )** - sets the screensize in pixels, should be called when the canvas resizes, needed if there are any pixel values assigned

## testing

Git clone, `npm install` and then run `npm start` to spin up a development server. Open `localhost:9966` in your browser to see the `test.js` file in action.

##Todo

- Expose a better mechanism to attach a material. Right now you can pass a `fragmentShader` argument, but the uniforms are obscured. You can still access them though with 'myScreenQuadInstance.material.uniforms'. A simple shader that reads the `uTexture` uniform:

	```glsl
	varying vec2 vUv;

	uniform sampler2D uTexture;

	void main(){

		gl_FragColor = texture2D( uTexture , vUv );

	}
	```
- ~~Add right, bottom anchors.~~
- Allow for aspect to be locked when resizing in one axis.
